## Design

Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:


>Mobile-first design


>Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.


>Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
